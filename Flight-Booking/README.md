<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
The main objective of this application is to decrease the manual mistakes engaged in the
commercial airline booking process and create it practical for the clients to book the routes as
when they require such that they can implement this application to create bookings, change
bookings or terminate a particular booking.
The name of the application is “AIRLINE BOOKING SYSTEM”. This application provides
alternatives for watching different routes available with different timings for a particular time
frame and provides clients with the service to publication a admission, change or terminate a
particular reservation but it does not offer the clients with information of price of the admission
and it does not allow the client to alter a particular aspect of his reservation and he/she can
change all his information. The software keep generating timely message regarding schedule
related updates to users.

<h1>Specific Technology</h1>
<p>Java, Applet</p>
<h1>Project Tasks</h1>
<p>Use case analysis, Design, Implementation, and User Interface</p>
<h1>Functional components of the project</h1>
<p>Following is a list of functionalities of the system. More functionality that you find appropriate
can be added to this list. And, in places where the description of functionality is not adequate,
you can make appropriate assumptions and proceed.
Existing Airline information is already stored in the local memory. Any new passenger
information can be stored in the local memory via a passenger information input screen. The
screen will take as input all the details of the passenger along with his name, the whole address
he belongs from, the journey details also the Identity proof details like Pan Card number etc.

The Airline data entry operator should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Login to the system through the first page of the application.</li>

seat number, the reservation number, etc.) as soon as a new passenger is being
entered into the system.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>The project presentation has to be done by each member to show periodically the progress and
the complete project submission should contain the following:
<ul>
<li>UML diagrams:-Use Case diagram, Class diagram, CRC diagram(s), illustrating the
design of your program.</li>
<li>All the Java source code should necessary to compile and execute.</li>
</ul>
